# Discord Clne

This is a Discord Clone tutorial I followed on youtube from Code With Antonio channel. 

Technologies that will be used was these:
> Next.js 13, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind, MySQL


Hopefully I'll surveve the 12 Hours tutorial. My goal is to learn realtime chat, video, voice so I can implement it to my upcomming web project that will benefit motorcycle riders
